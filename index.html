    <p>Please note this is a demonstration website to show how the final product would operate. This website will allow school teachers to quickly register and record the attendance of their students. The registration process will go through when a student didn't attend, how long they were away, and the reason for it. This will be done through a simple log-in, where the teacher selects the school or academy they work in and log-in into their repective account, in which they'll have access to a list of their students.</p>
